# Ticket Reservation System

This is a C++ based Ticket Reservation System developed as a second-semester project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The system manages event bookings and administrative controls through a console-based interface.

## 🛠️ Features & C++ Concepts Used

The project implements the following technical requirements:

* **Data Members & Member Functions:** Used to define object attributes and behaviors.
* **Validation:** Strict data validation in set functions using `if`, `for`, and `while` structures.
* **Overloading & Function Templates:** Enhanced flexibility for function calls and generic logic.
* **Constructors:** Defining default values for constructor parameters.
* **Include Guards:** Ensuring header files are included only once during compilation.
* **Destructor Function:** Proper cleanup of objects and resources.
* **Static Variables and Functions:** Managing shared data across all instances of a class.
* **Friend Functions:** Allowing specific functions to access private class members.
* **Composition:** Building complex classes by combining multiple objects.
